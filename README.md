# Parking Management System


- The aim of this project is to automate the car and the car parking as well. It discusses a project which presents a miniature model of an automated car parking system that can regulate and manage the number of cars that can be parked in a given space at any given time based on the availability of parking spots.
- Our project can lead to an error free, secure, reliable and fast management system. It can assist the user to concentrate on other activities rather than to concentrate on record keeping. Our application can maintain computerized records without redundant entries. 
- Basically the project describes how to manage for good performance and better service.



## Objectives
